			<p>People born in the Year of the Snake are deep. They say little and possess great wisdom. They never have to worry about money; they are financially 
			fortunate. Snake people are often quite vain, selfish, and a bit stingy. Yet they have tremendous sympathy for others and try to help those less fortunate. 
			Snake people tend to overdo, since they have doubts about other people's judgment and prefer to rely on themselves. They are determined in whatever 
			they do and hate to fail. Although calm on the surface, they are intense and passionate. Snake people are usually good-looking and sometimes have martial
			problems because they are fickle. They are most compatible with the Ox and Rooster.
			</p>
		<h2>Health</h2>
			<p>Snakes prefer living a life of calmness, preferring quietness over noise and a manageable workload rather than a schedule that’s overly-booked. Snakes
			become easily stressed when their lives aren’t peaceful or in order. Too much of this way of life can shorten a snake’s life!
			</p>
		<h2>Career</h2>
			<p>Snakes do work very hard, but they have a tendency to be job-hoppers as they become easily bored. Their somewhat laid-back attitude causes them to 
			be mistakenly categorized as slackers, but nothing could be further from the truth! Snakes are very creative and extremely diligent. They’re excellent 
			problem-solvers and thrive under tight deadlines. Good career choices for Snakes include: scientist, analyst, investigator, painter, potter, jeweler, astrologer, 
			magician, dietician, and sociologist.
			</p>
		<h2>Relationships</h2>
			<p>Snakes are excellent seducers so they never have trouble attracting others. However, they’ll be the ones to decide when a relationship has potential and 
			when it does not. Once they’ve chosen a partner, a Snake’s insecure side will begin to show through. Snakes guards their chosen partners much like a prized 
			possessions, becoming jealous and even obsessive. Snakes prefer to keep their feelings to themselves. It’s important to never betray a Snake’s trust as a 
			betrayed snake will make it a goal to get even some day!
