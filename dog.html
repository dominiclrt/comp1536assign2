				<p>People born in the Year of the Dog possess the best traits of human nature. They have a deep sense of loyalty, are honest, 
					and inspire other people´s confidence because they know how to keep secrets. But Dog People are somewhat selfish, terribly 
					stubborn, and eccentric. They care little for wealth, yet somehow always seem to have money. They can be cold emotionally and 
					sometimes distant at parties. They can find fault with many things and are noted for their sharp tongues. Dog people make good 
					leaders. They are compatible with those born in the Years of the Horse, Tiger, and Rabbit.
				</p>
				
				<h2>Health</h2>
				
				<p>A happy Dog is a healthy Dog and it’s easy to tell by the Dog’s sad or depressed appearance that it’s not feeling right. Dogs 
					are resilient, especially when fighting illness.
				</p>
				
				<h2>Career</h2>
				
				<p>Coworkers can always count on Dogs to help out, especially if it means the Dog will learn something new or alleviate the 
					workload of others. Dogs are seen as valuable employees. Good career choices for Dogs include: police officer, scientist, counselor, 
					interior designer, professor, politician, priest, nurse, clerk and Judge.
				</p>
				
				<h2>Relationships</h2>
				
				<p>Although Dogs are trustworthy, they have trouble trusting others. It can take a long time before a Dog feels at ease with 
					another person. When Dogs don’t build trust they’re judgmental and rough towards others. When it comes to romance Dogs often
					have a tough time. Others are often scared off by the Dog’s insecure, worrisome and frequently anxious nature. Dogs are known 
					to be cold emotionally and critical.
