			<p>People born in the Year of the Monkey are the erratic geniuses of the cycle. Clever, skillful, and flexible, they are remarkably 
			inventive and original and can solve the most difficult problems with ease. There are few fields in which Monkey people wouldn't
			be successful but they have a disconcerting habit of being too agreeable. They want to do things now, and if they cannot get 
			started immediately, they become discouraged and sometimes leave their projects. Although good at making decisions, they tend
			to look down on others. Having common sense, Monkey people have a deep desire for knowledge and have excellent memories. 
			Monkey people are strong willed but their anger cools quickly. They are most compatible with the Dragon and Rat.
			</p>
		<h2>Health</h2>
			<p>Believing that being sick is a waste of a valuable day, Monkeys very rarely feel ill. Their constantly active lifestyles are likely 
			what helps Monkeys remain in good health. When Monkeys do become ill, such feelings are generally the result of feeling nervous.
			</p>
		<h2>Career</h2>
			<p>When it comes to work, Monkeys can do just about anything. They adapt well to changing environments and they’re very intelligent. 
			They work quickly, but they’ll frequently charge double for their services. Good career fields for Monkeys are accounting and banking. 
			Other good careers for Monkeys include: scientist, engineer, stock market trader, air traffic controller, dealer, film director, jeweler and 
			sales representative.
			</p>
		<h2>Relationships</h2>
			<p>When it comes to relationships, Monkeys aren’t quick to settle down. In fact, they generally are promiscuous; a tendency that probably
			has to do with the fact that Monkeys are easily bored. Monkeys will end this type of behavior once they pair up with the perfect partner. 
			In fact, more often than not, they’ll commit to that person in every way for life.
