			<p>People born in the Year of the Rooster are deep thinkers, capable, and talented. They like to be busy and are devoted
			beyond their capabilities and are deeply disappointed if they fail. People born in the Rooster Year are often a bit eccentric, 
			and often have rather difficult relationship with others. They always think they are right and usually are! They frequently 
			are loners and though they give the outward impression of being adventurous, they are timid. Rooster people's emotions 
			like their fortunes, swing very high to very low. They can be selfish and too outspoken, but are always interesting and can 
			be extremely brave. They are most compatible with Ox, Snake, and Dragon.
			</p>
		<h2>Health</h2>
			<p>Overall, Roosters are active individuals and their preference to be active helps keep them in good health. When they 
			do become ill, they feel better quickly. They can at times however, take on too much and when that happens, they’ll feel
			stressed and moody.
			</p>
		<h2>Career</h2>
			<p>Roosters are highly motivated and hard-working; traits that enable most Roosters to have successful careers. Not 
			surprisingly, Roosters make good actors, musicians and dancers. Other good career choices for Roosters include: CPA, banker,
			dentist, insurance agent, secretary, and book keeper. Roosters also do well in the armed forces.
			</p>
		<h2>Relationships</h2>
			<p>The Rooster’s bossiness and honest “tell it like it is” approach doesn’t work well with sensitive individuals. Roosters need
			to partner with those who are tough-skinned. They’re the individuals most capable of realizing that beneath the tough exteriors
			are huge, caring hearts overflowing with love.
