							<h1>Chinese Zodiac History</h1>
								<p>Legends and mythology are a big part of Chinese culture, especially in relation to the Chinese Zodiac. 
								The 12 animals that appear on the Chinese Zodiac calendar include a rat, buffalo (ox), tiger, rabbit, dragon, 
								snake, horse, goat, monkey, rooster, dog and pig. It’s an unusual combination of animals for sure, and their 
								appearance on the Chinese Zodiac is the topic of countless legends and is deeply embedded in Chinese mythology.
								</p>
								<p>The most well-known of the Chinese zodiac legends states that Buddha invited the animals to participate in a race. 
								The prize was a coveted position on the Chinese Zodiac calendar. The first 12 animals to cross the river would appear on 
								the Chinese Zodiac calendar in the order in which they completed the race. The first animal to make it across the finish 
								line according to Chinese Zodiac legends and mythology was the rat. It seems unlikely that such a small animal could win 
								such a strenuous race, especially when one considers all the contenders.
								</p>
								<p>Chinese Zodiac legends and mythology explains that the rat used his brain rather than his brawn. It hitched a ride on
								what it perceived was the mightiest swimmer. Just before the buffalo reached the shore, the rat jumped off the buffalo’s back 
								and crossed the finish line before the buffalo, putting the rat in first place. The buffalo came in second and as promised in the 
								legends and mythology, was the second animal listed on the Chinese Zodiac. The tiger, also being strong, came in third, 
								followed by the rabbit that jumped his way across and was helped during the last stretch by the dragon. A snake hid in the hoof 
								of the horse which is how it managed to make it across the river. At the last minute the snake jumped out and scared the horse 
								into seventh place.
								</p>
								<p>The history of the Chinese Zodiac weaves another intriguing tale. This one tells of an invitation to a grand feast. All the animals 
								were invited to join Buddha at either a birthday celebration, a New Year celebration, or a celebration for his departure from this world.
								Only 12 animals showed up at the festivities and that’s how they ended up being featured on the Chinese Zodiac calendar. Another 
								of the legends of the Chinese Zodiac states that instead of Buddha, it was the Jade Emperor who invited the animals. Regardless of 
								the specific version of Chinese Zodiac history to which you subscribe, the Chinese Zodiac has amazed and entertained people around
								the world for thousands of years.
