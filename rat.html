			<p>People born in the Year of the Rat are noted for their charm and attraction for the opposite sex. They work hard to achieve their goals, acquire possessions,
			and are likely to be perfectionists. They are basically thrifty with money. Rat people are easily angered and love to gossip. Their ambitions are big, and
			they are usually very successful. They are most compatible with people born in the years of the Dragon, Monkey, and Ox.
			</p>
		<h2>Health</h2>
			<p>Overall Rats enjoy good health. They’re very active which helps keep them in shape and able to fight off sickness. They can at times be tense, aggressive, 
			and full of nervous energy, conditions which can lead to stress. Regular exercise designed to calm will benefit Rats.
			</p>
		<h2>Career</h2>
			<p>Extremely perceptive and wise, Rats can focus on the big picture. That ability along with their good judgment enables Rats to solve problems before they 
			arise. Rats focus on titles because titles translate into status and money; two motivating forces. Rats make excellent bosses. Routine halts their creativity so 
			Rats need flexible positions that allow creativity. Good career choices include: administrator, director, manager, entrepreneur, broadcaster, writer, musician, 
			stand-up comedian, politician, lawyer, researcher, and race car driver.
			</p>
		<h2>Relationships</h2>
			<p>Rats are very charming. They enjoy social activities and because they’re out a lot, they’re always meeting new people. They aren’t good at breaking off 
			relationships however, and this presents problems going forward with new relationships. Anyone hoping to partner with a Rat must be able to keep up with
			the Rat’s active nature.
