			<p>People born in the Year of Ram are elegant and highly accomplished in the arts. They seem to be, at first glance, better off 
			than those born in the zodiac's other years. But ram year people are often shy, pessimistic, and puzzled about life. They are 
			usually deeply religious, yet timid by nature. Sometimes clumsy in speech, they are always passionate about what they do and 
			what they believe in. Ram people never have to worry about having the best in life for their abilities make money for them, and 
			they are able to enjoy the creature comforts that they like. Ram people are wise, gentle, and compassionate. They are compatible 
			with Rabbits, Pigs, and Horses.

		<h2>Health</h2>
			<p>Perhaps because Goats are basically serene, they tend to have fewer health problems. Their fragile exterior hides the fact 
			they’re typically very healthy. When they’re happy, they’re healthy. When Goats become unhappy, especially as a result of romance, 
			they quickly become sick.
			</p>
		<h2>Career</h2>
			<p>Goats at work prefer being part of a flock. Power and status aren’t important. Goats will only assume leadership roles when
			asked directly. They’ll never volunteer. Good career choices for Goats include: florist, interior designer, daycare teacher, pediatrician, 
				actor, editor, hair stylist, illustrator, musician, and art history teacher.
			</p>
		<h2>Relationships</h2>
			<p>Goats tend to be private, so it can take effort to get to know one. The Goat is the one who will decide when and with whom it will
			share its personal life. As a result, most Goats have few close friends, yet they’ll work hard for those they love.
