		<h1>Ox</h1>

        <p id="year">1997, 2009, 2021</p>
			<p>People born in the Year of the Ox are patient, speak little, and inspire confidence in others. They tend, however, to be eccentric, 
			and bigoted, and they anger easily. They have fierce tempers and although they speak little, when they do they are quite eloquent. 
			Ox people are mentally and physically alert. Generally easy-going, they can be remarkably stubborn, and they hate to fail or be opposed.
			They are most compatible with Snake, Rooster, and Rat people.
			</p>
		<h2>Health</h2>
			<p>Oxen are strong individuals who overall are healthy and live long, fulfilled lives. However, they tend to work too much, rarely allowing 
			themselves enough time to relax. Oxen could benefit from incorporating more non-work-related activity into their lives.
			</p>
		<h2>Career</h2>
			<p>Oxen prefer work that is routine. They take a methodological approach to their tasks and excel in jobs that are specialized. Oxen 
			possess a keen eye for detail and an admirable work ethic. They are more productive when allowed to work alone. Good career choices for 
			oxen include: interior designer, painter, carpenter, quarry worker, archeologist, horticulturist, mechanic, engineer, draftsman, banker, 
			broker, real estate agent and army officer.
			</p>
		<h2>Relationships</h2>
			<p>Oxen aren’t very sociable and rarely participate in group activities. They abhor small talk and won’t waste their time flirting. They will 
			search long and hard for the perfect partner as change makes them uncomfortable. Whether due to an ox’s tendency to be overbearing or
			tendency to place blame on others, relationships with Oxen don’t always work out. When Oxen realize that partnerships involve two people
			and two points of view, satisfying matches are possible.
