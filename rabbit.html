				<p>People born in the Year of the Rabbit are articulate, talented, and ambitious. They are virtuous, reserved, and have excellent taste. Rabbit
					people are admired, trusted, and are often financially lucky. They are fond of gossip but are tactful and generally kind. Rabbit people seldom 
					lose their temper. They are clever at business and being conscientious, never back out of a contract. They would make good gamblers for they 
					have the uncanny gift of choosing the right thing. However, they seldom gamble, as they are conservative and wise. They are most compatible 
					with those born in the years of the Sheep, Pig, and Dog.
				</p>
				
				<h2>Health</h2>
				
				<p>Even though Rabbits don’t usually get visibly upset or stressed, they do tend to keep these feelings inside. When they don’t express these 
					feelings, such feeling can cause Rabbits to become ill. Rabbits could benefit from more everyday activity which would reduce their stress levels 
					and better their health.
				</p>
				
				<h2>Career</h2>
				
				<p>Rabbits are articulate and good communicators which is why friends and acquaintances seek out their advice. It’s also why Rabbits make 
					excellent diplomats and politicians. Other good careers for Rabbits include: writer, publisher, actor, fashion designer, therapist, doctor, administrator, 
					public relations, and teacher.
				</p>
				
				<h2>Relationships</h2>
				
				<p>Rabbits are very sexual, but tend to give more of themselves than they should. This can lead to unrealistic expectations and unhealthy 
					situations. Rabbits need partners who won’t take advantage of their giving nature. Such pairings will be strong.
